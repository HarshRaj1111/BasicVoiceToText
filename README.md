Developed a Python-based voice-to-text assistant using libraries like SpeechRecognition and PyAudio. The
 assistant not only converts spoken language into text with high accuracy but also functions as a voice assistant,
 responding to user commands and performing tasks such as opening applications, setting reminders, and searching
 the web.
